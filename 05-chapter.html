<h1>Python, IDLE and your first program</h1>

<section data-type="sect1">
<p>In this chapter you are going to:</p>

<p>&bull; learn about computer programming and the different languages that you can use<br />
&bull; meet the Python programming language<br />
&bull; learn how to use IDLE, which will help organise your programs and allow you to run<br />
them easily<br />
&bull; check that your computer has been set up correctly<br />
&bull; write and run your fi rst program.</p>

<p>type something</p>

<p>=== Coding<br />
Coding is writing instructions for a computer to perform a task. This code has to be in a form<br />
that the computer can understand. This is more formally known as computer programming.<br />
Computers and coding have not been around for a long time but they have sure packed in<br />
some interesting history in a short space of time. The fi rst machine that stored instructions<br />
in a way that future computers could take advantage of was the Jacquard loom that used<br />
holes punched in cards and was invented in 1801. Charles Babbage is often credited with<br />
inventing the fi rst computer which he described in 1837 but was not built until 100 years<br />
later. In 1989 Guido van Rossum started to create the Python programming language which<br />
he named after Monty Python&rsquo;s Flying Circus, a BBC comedy sketch show.</p>

<p>=== Programming languages<br />
There are many programming languages currently used by coders around the world. Some<br />
are best in one situation, others in another.<br />
&bull; HTML is good for producing web pages.<br />
&bull; SQL is great at making databases do what you want.<br />
&bull; Python is brilliant for writing quick applications, running programming experiments<br />
and for building larger applications, including games.</p>

<p>If you have previously programmed in Scratch (produced by MIT) you will fi nd you can<br />
pick up Python very quickly. Scratch is great for learning how to think like a programmer&nbsp;and is very good for making games. If you have not tried Scratch before, you might&nbsp;enjoy trying that next because the ability to learn a new programming language is an&nbsp;important skill for coders. You will find it is a lot easier than learning a new human&nbsp;language.<br />
Once you have learned one modern programming language, you can quickly learn others.<br />
You simply have to fi nd out how your new language handles variables, loops, etc. (You will&nbsp;know what these are by the end of the book.)</p>

<p>=== Python<br />
Python is a typed computer language. This makes writing short programs very fast and you<br />
can produce almost anything you can imagine.<br />
Python is a powerful, modern programming language used by many famous organisations<br />
such as YouTube and NASA. It is one of three programming languages that can be used to<br />
write Google Apps. Python is a great language. Enjoy!</p>

<p>=== IDLE<br />
You will start programming in IDLE which comes with Python. IDLE is a special text editor<br />
like Microsoft Word, except it understands Python and helps you get your code right. IDLE is<br />
itself, a Python application.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at IDLE:<br />

IDLE when started on an Apple Mac.</p>

<p>The code you want to run is typed after the special entry prompt<br />
To run the code we press the return key. This is how Python runs in IDLE&rsquo;s interactive mode.<br />
Python can run fi les as well but to start with, this is all we need.</p>
