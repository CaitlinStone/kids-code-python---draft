<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>Coding is writing instructions for a computer to perform a task. This code has to be in a form&nbsp;that the computer can understand. This is more formally known as computer programming.</p>

<p>Computers and coding have not been around for a long time but they have sure packed in&nbsp;some interesting history in a short space of time. The first machine that stored instructions&nbsp;in a way that future computers could take advantage of was the Jacquard loom that used&nbsp;holes punched in cards and was invented in 1801. Charles Babbage is often credited with&nbsp;inventing the first computer which he described in 1837 but was not built until 100 years&nbsp;later.</p>

<p>In 1989 Guido van Rossum started to create the Python programming language which&nbsp;he named after Monty Python&rsquo;s Flying Circus, a BBC comedy sketch show.</p>

<h2>Programming languages</h2>

<p>There are many programming languages currently used by coders around the world. Some&nbsp;are best in one situation, others in another.</p>

<p>&bull; HTML is good for producing web pages.<br />
&bull; SQL is great at making databases do what you want.<br />
&bull; Python is brilliant for writing quick applications, running programming experiments&nbsp;and for building larger applications, including games.</p>

<p>If you have previously programmed in Scratch (produced by MIT) you will find you can&nbsp;pick up Python very quickly. Scratch is great for learning how to think like a programmer&nbsp;and is very good for making games. If you have not tried Scratch before, you might&nbsp;enjoy trying that next because the ability to learn a new programming language is an&nbsp;important skill for coders. You will find it is a lot easier than learning a new human&nbsp;language.</p>

<p>Once you have learned one modern programming language, you can quickly learn others. &nbsp;You simply have to find out how your new language handles variables, loops, etc. (You will&nbsp;know what these are by the end of the book.)</p>

<h2>Python</h2>

<p>Python is a typed computer language. This makes writing short programs very fast and you&nbsp;can produce almost anything you can imagine.</p>

<p>Python is a powerful, modern programming language used by many famous organisations&nbsp;such as YouTube and NASA. It is one of three programming languages that can be used to&nbsp;write Google Apps. Python is a great language. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>IDLE</h2>

<p>You will start programming in IDLE which comes with Python. IDLE is a special text editor&nbsp;like Microsoft Word, except it understands Python and helps you get your code right. IDLE is&nbsp;itself, a Python application.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at IDLE:<br />

IDLE when started on an Apple Mac.</p>

<p>The code you want to run is typed after the special entry prompt<br />
To run the code we press the return key. This is how Python runs in IDLE&rsquo;s interactive mode.</p>

<p>Python can run files as well but to start with, this is all we need.</p>
